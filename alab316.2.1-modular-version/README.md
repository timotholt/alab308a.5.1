Rescue Goose!
A Javascript game that the user interacts with the BOM and the DOM.
Loosely based upon Top Gun, it's about rescuing Goose from the ocean
after the F14 crash! Includes all new Tom Cruise audio clips
generated from Eleven Labs and the famouse Theme song you all love!  

1. Input the name of the pilot you want to rescue.  He can't be seen
until you are within 3 spaces of him.

2. Move your ship to any square on the board with the mouse.  The DOM is
updated to draw the ship in the square you click on.

3. To help you find Goose, use your ears to listen to the sonar.
Higher pings = closer. Lower pings = farther.  The difference is subtle!

4. When you get withion 3 spaces of the stranded aviator, you will see him!

5. Click on him to rescue him! Wait a second while the crew pulls him up!
